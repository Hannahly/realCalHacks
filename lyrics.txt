27994 "(Strummer)    I could see as I rode in  The ships were gone and the pit fell in  A funeral bell tolled the hour in  A lonely drunkard slumbering    Not the twang of the guitar  Not even the siren wail of pain  Not the shadows of desire  Caught in the pouring pouring rain    Breeze black windows on date street  Where I was raised up on the cheap  (yeah, say!) ask no questions work and sleep  'til the old tango that's on date street    I can hear the sharpen of the pain  Some lucky stranger in the rain  Hear the sharpen of the rain  Lucky stranger... In the rain    Hammers beat in dusty times  On these weedy rusted lines  Mocking the sun and optomistic signs  All these weedy gates of iron    The sun won't shine my way again  Lucky moon was on the wane  Oh I'll never see a star again  In the pouring pouring rain    A salty band played for the train  A sad trombone and some refrain  The future pointed to the weather vane  The old calypso died of shame    I hear the sharpen of the pain  Some lucky stranger in the rian  Hear the sharpen of the pain  Lucky stranger pouring rain    Pouring rain!!!"
27837 "(Lyrics by Harry Connick, Jr.)    I think I saw ol' Santa through my window Christmas eve  My eyes were really droopy but I really do believe  It must've been ol' Santa 'cause I saw his big red hat  And I know my mom and dad can't fly like that    And then I heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door  The same ol' Christmas trick my dad had played since I was four  He stands outside my bedroom yelling ""Ho! Ho! Ho!"" because  He knows I don't believe in Santa Claus    I think my daddy sees me  Peeking from my door  But he pretends he's Santa anyway  Every year he tries to fool me  But I'm a big boy now I don't believe in Santa or his sleigh...  No way!    So I went back to bed and I curled up nice and tight  I stared out my window and looked into the night  And then, all of a sudden, through my window I could see  Santa Claus was flying by and smiling at me    [Chorus:]  Santa Claus, Santa Claus  It must've been ol' Santa Claus  Santa Claus, Santa Claus  Happy ""Ho! Ho! Ho!"" to you    Then I heard ol' Rudolph tellin' me to come outside  He told me that ol' Santa wanted me to take a ride  I climbed out of my window and I jumped onto his sleigh  Then ol' Santa took me up up and away    We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below  I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show  It was really past my bedtime and so ol' Santa said  ""Little boys like you should be in bed""    So I hollered ""Ho! Ho! Ho!""  And I put on Santa's hat  Then he let me hold the reins awhile  We pulled up to my window  And I jumped back in my room  And I waved goodbye to Santa with a smile    When I woke up Christmas morning it was clear and bright  My parents said my window had blown open in the night  I smiled as I told them that it must've been the cat  And they asked me where I got my big red hat    [Chorus:]"

6942 "You might think ther'e some big reason  Why I took this time to write  The cards and letters there's been to few of those  But I just stopped to realize  How long that I've been gone  But there's a few small things I need to know.    Dear Daddy do the whipperwill still echo through the night?  Does the sound of silence squeeze the morning light?  And have you caught the big one in the pond just down the road?  I miss you so.    Well years keep slipping by me  Like miles out on the road  But I don't guess I'll change my way of life  There's no harm in holding memories  But please tell me if you can  If I can bring those old times inside.    Dear Mama can you still find the dipper in the stars?  Do the roads still go for hours without cars?  Does the frost still shine on the grass outside the door?  Just like before  Tell me more.    Is Sis still planning marriage sometime soon?  Can you still reach out and touch the moon?  Do old songs still ring out through the hills for days and days?    Love always"

Listen to the tales as we all rationalize,  Our way into the arms of the savior.  Fading all the trials and the tribulations,  None of us have actually been there.  Not like you.    Ignorant fibbers in the congregation.  Gather around spewing sympathy.  Spare me  None of them can even hold a candle up to you,  Blinded by choices hypocrites won't see.    But enough about the collective Judas  Who could deny you were the one who illuminated.  Your little piece of the divine.    This little light of mine,  The gift you passed onto me.  I'll let it shine,  To guide you safely on your way.  Your way home.    What are they going to do when the lights go down?  Without you to guide them all to Zion?  What are they going to do when the rivers overrun?  Other than tremble incessantly.    High is the way, but our eyes are upon the ground  You were the light and the way that they'll only read about.  I only pray Heaven knows when to lift you out.  Ten thousand days in the fire is long enough.  You're going home.    You're the only one who can hold your head up high.    Shake your fist at the gates saying:  I have come home now.  Fetch me the spirit.  The son, and the father.  Tell them their pillar of faith has ascended.  It's time now, my time now.  Give me my, give me my, wings.    Give me my,  Give me my wings.    You are the light, a way.  That they will only read about.    Set as I am in my ways and my arrogance.  Burden of proof tossed upon non-believers.  You were my witness.  My eyes, my evidence.  Judith Marie, unconditional one.    Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence.  Difficult to see you in this light.  Please forgive this bold suggestion  Should you see your maker's face tonight.  Look him in the eye  Look him in the eye, and tell him.  I never lived a lie, never took a life.  But surely saved one, hallelujah.  It's time for you to bring me home."

Revenge is mine  12 people will die tonight""  [Violent J]  Now I look and then reborn  Though I have just until dawn  I remember every face  Spirits show me every place  First one sleeps inside his bed  Place my fingers on his head  To each temple push and smother  Till my fingers touch each other  [Shaggy 2 Dope]  Next one makes love to his wife  Only wish to take his life  For his family's done no wrong  Place his children on the lawn  Tell the misses, leave the room  Less she wish to witness doom  Grab the squirming filthy goat  And shove the dresser down his throat  [Violent J]  I must quickly use my gift  Next two work the midnight shift  Drinking coffee in the back  I will listen to them chat  Hear them speaking of my death  Hear the laughter in their breath  But the laughter quickly died  When their heads collide  Die!  You're gonna die...  [Violent J]  Now my anger's growing worse  Next one's working as a nurse  Have to make a doctor's call  Drag my body down the hall  Grab a scalple and a blade  Time to play the nurse's aide  Operate and strap her down  Carve her face into a clown  [Shaggy 2 Dope]  Killed another then three more  Now we're down to only four  This man drives a taxi cab  Another wicked life to grab  Screaming that he'd thought I'd died  Let's go for a taxi ride  In the wreck of twisted steel  The stearing wheel becomes his meal  [Violent J]  This man watches his TV  Scanning channels endlessly  Stops at station forty-four  It's the Wicked Clown Show  Watch me juggle, watch me dance  In 3-D watch me enhance  Watch me crawl out from the screen  And squeeze your neck until you're green  Die!  You're gonna die...  Time...  [Violent J]  Even though, there's just one left  I feel my bones becoming stiff  And now I wonder endlessly  The spirits have abandoned me  My limbs are falling piece by piece  My ears and fingers in the street  But still yet see no morning sun  And here's my victim's early run  [Shaggy 2 Dope]  Quickly grab him from behind  Round his neck with fishing twine  Keep him still and pull the string  Watch his head go bobbaling  Listen to my riddle song  Even though my crime was wrong  Murder me just for your law  And I'll be back for all y'all  Die!  You're gonna die...  I'll be back for all y'all..."

I think we made a wrong turn now look at hte lovely concrete  I drove to my stupid job today, got stopped at an intersection  15 minutes of my life just rolled away  I looked at the guy next to me he didn't seem so happy  No ones happy but everyone's too busy to see  Let's go shopping today  Drive our fancy cars to the fancy malls and for lunch we'll have big macs  I wish I could turn the clock back to when I was ten  When I wasn't scared of everything  And everything wasn't so fucking crowded  And I wonder if my kids will ever see a horizon  Untouched by billboards and shopping malls  And I wonder if this crazy world thinks I'm the one who's crazy  What if I'm the one who's crazy?  What if I'm the one who's crazy?  I'm not crazy just frustrated      "

Saugatuck River's flowin', Mother nature's colors were showin'  So cold, so rainy, we couldn't help feelin' blue  Not enough time, too many things to do.    We met a young girl on Main street, wanted to just pass her by  She was homely, so lonely, She said, ""Can I make love to you.""  We shouted 157 Riverside Avenue.    It's over, Miss Lena, we're leaving. Such a pleasant stay, I must say.  So nice, so easy, we hate to say goodbye to you  At 157 Riverside Avenue."

45001 "(copyright nazareth, tiflis tunes,inc.-ascap)      Mist upon the hill can remember murder,  Mist upon the hill that once flowed with blood,  Helped to cover up an approaching army,  Hid the killing lust in the eyes of men.    Sitting by the fire was a sentry sleeping,  Rolled up in their beds were children that play,  Unsuspecting what was to fall upon them,  None of them would see the dawn next day.    Bloody were the blades that fell on children,  Hate the blinding light tried to kill a name,  The mountains only know all the souls that died there,  Glen coe from that day can recall the shame.    The quiet of the night never gave them warning,  The silence of the hills wouldn't let them know,  They'd never rise again on a mist filled morning,  Never see the sunrise above glen coe."

Let us dance beneath the moon  I'll sing to you 'Claire de Lune'  The morning always comes too soon  But tonight the war is over  He speaks to me in schoolboy French  Of a soldier's life inside a trench  Of the look of death and the ghastly stench  I do my best to please him    He puts two roses in a vase  Two roses sadly out of place  Like the gallant smile on his haggard face  Playfully I tease him  Hold me 'neath the Paris skies  Let's not talk of how or why  Tomorrow's soon enough to die  But tonight the war is over  We make love too hard, too fast  He falls asleep, his face a mask  He wakes with the shakes, and he drinks from his flask  I put my arms around him    They die in the trenches and they die in the air  In Belgium and France the dead are everywhere  They die so, so fast there's no time to prepare  A decent grave to surround them  Old world glory, old world fame  The old world's gone, gone up in flames  Nothing will ever be the same  And nothing lasts forever  Oh, I'd pray for him but I've forgotten how  And there's nothing, nothing that can save him now  There's always another with the same funny bow  And who am I to deny them?
